From that modest beginning, container shipping developed into a huge industry that made the boom in global trade possible.

## Security

- [Wikipedia article on supply chain security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_security) *Supply-chain security refers to efforts to enhance the security of the supply chain, the transport and logistics system for the world's cargo. It combines traditional practices of supply-chain management with the security requirements driven by threats such as terrorism, piracy, and theft.*
- [Supply Chain Security: A Comprehensive Approach](https://www.crcpress.com/Supply-Chain-Security-A-Comprehensive-Approach/Arway/p/book/9781466511873) by Arthur G. Arway. *The supply chain is a complex system of numerous, integrated stakeholders. These stakeholders are responsible for the transportation, storage, documentation, and handling of material goods and cargo. Each entity has its own unique relationship with and role within the chain—as well as its own unique security requirements. The challenge of trying to secure the supply chain at every level is both a domestic and global concern. In this global economy, companies must be able to integrate security into supply chain logistics to protect their employees, assets, and clients from incidents of theft and other damaging events.*
